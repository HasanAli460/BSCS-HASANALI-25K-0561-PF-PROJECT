# Tourist Management System (C Project)

This is my Programming Fundamentals lab project.  
It’s a simple console-based **tourist management system** made in C where you can:

- choose a destination  
- pick flights & hotels based on that destination  
- enter traveller details  
- calculate total cost  
- save bookings into a file (`info.txt`)  
- search bookings by ID  

The program is beginner-friendly. I tried to keep the code simple and easy to understand.

## Features
- destination-wise flights & hotels  
- automatic checkout date calculation  
- unique ID checking  
- ticket printing and cost summary  
- stores records in a text file
